On running the demo for ip_basic depth_completion.py 
an output folder will be created, with depth images.

The output were used by segment.py created by our group, which takes in 
original image and depth image created by ip_basic and overlay them create
a new image. Meanshift is used to perform segmentation the original image 
and blended image.
